# PyAF_Benchmarks

This repository contains/will contain benchmarks results/logs that are used to evaluate PyAF automatic forecasting tool.

The benchmarks are official forecasting competitions : [M1, M2, M3, M4 , NN3 and NN5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makridakis_Competitions)

Some are internal benchmarks (used mainly to evaluate new PyAF versions against previopus ones) : YahooStocks (all stocks by index are forecast for 7 days).

We will run these benchmarks on a regular basis and update this repository when something changes.

Scripts used to run the benchamrks are included with pyaf : https://github.com/antoinecarme/pyaf/tree/master/benches
